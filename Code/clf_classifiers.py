class BalancedRandomForest(object):
    """
    A balanced random forest classifier. Takes a bootstrap sample of the
    minority class and takes a random sample from the majority class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer
        The number of trees in the forest.
    criterion : string
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "entropy" for the information gain.
    max_features : int, float, string or None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a percentage and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
    max_depth : integer or None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.
    min_samples_split : int, float
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
    min_samples_leaf : int, float
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
    max_leaf_nodes : int or None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    min_impurity_split : float
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.
    ratio : string or float
        Determines the size of the random sample from the majority class.
        'auto' takes a sample equal to the bootstrap sample of the minority
        class. If the ratio is set with a float the majority sample will be
        1/ratio times as large as the bootstrap sample of the minority class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    forest : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
    n_estimators : int
        The number of decision trees.
    tree_params : dictionary
        The parameters used for each decision tree.
    ratio : float
        The ratio between majority and minority class samples.
    n_features : int
        The number of features.
    n_classes : int
        The number of classes (currently only 2 supported).
    n_samples : int
        The number of samples.
    feature_importances_ : array
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

    fit(X, y)
        Build a forest of trees from the training set (X, y).
